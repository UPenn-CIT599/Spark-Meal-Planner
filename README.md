# mealplanner
This is a group project for CIT 591 class. The meal planner program aims to simplify a userâ€™s process of creating a meal plan and grocery shopping list on a weekly basis. The meal planner allows a user to select and save their favorite recipes, generate a weekly schedule of meals as well as a grocery list, after considering existing pantry items. The recipes can be searched from an online database or a user selected URL (if feasible) using an API.

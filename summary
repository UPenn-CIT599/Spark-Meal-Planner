Project Description: 

The meal planner app aims to simplify a user’s process of creating a meal plan and grocery shopping list on 
a weekly basis. The meal planner allows a user to select and save their favorite recipes, generate a weekly 
schedule of meals as well as a grocery list, after considering existing pantry items based on the user input. 
The recipes to add to the meal plan can be searched from directly from the application as powered by 
Yummly.com or it can be inputed manually using a user selected URL. The user has access to their meal plans 
in the calendar view, and for future use, the calendar and grocery lists can be saved or printed. Instructions 
on saving the page are provided on the Frequently Asked Questions page of the application.
